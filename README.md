# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction: An R-Based Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains an R-based analysis project aimed at predicting bike-sharing demand. By leveraging machine learning models like Random Forest and Linear Regression, the project seeks to uncover patterns and factors that significantly impact bike-sharing usage.

## Project Structure
- **R Scripts**: Core analysis and model-building scripts (`RANDOM_FOREST (2).R`, `Linear_Regression.R`).
- **Data**: The dataset used for training the models (`train.csv`).
- **Visualizations**: Output images showcasing model performance and data insights.
- **Documentation**: Detailed report and presentation on project findings and methodology.

## Technologies
- **R**: Used for all data processing, model building, and analysis.
- **RStudio (Recommended)**: For executing the R scripts and reproducing the analysis.

## Getting Started
1. Install R and optionally RStudio.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the R scripts and execute them in order to reproduce the analysis and models.
4. Review the visualizations and report for detailed insights.

## Contributions
Contributions to improve the project or extend the analysis are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repo, add your modifications, and submit a pull request.
